# Comment-system
In this project,I implemented a comment system. It fulfills the requirements below:

Add comments (store them somewhere so it persists even after your program is restarted),
view comments, and
reply to comments

To complete the above tasks,
1. I used the Flask framework for coding the API in python.
2. I used the MongoDB database for storing the documents to deal with nested documents.
